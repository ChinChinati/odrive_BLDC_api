# ODrive Pro API

This repository contains a Python API for controlling an ODrive Pro motor controller connected to a high-torque BLDC motor. The API is designed to provide a straightforward interface for basic motor operations, including connecting to the ODrive Pro, starting and stopping the motor, and setting control parameters like velocity, position, and current.

## Features

- **Easy Connection**: Quickly establish a connection with the ODrive Pro motor controller.
- **Motor Control**: Start and stop the motor with simple function calls.
- **Control Parameters**: Adjust critical parameters such as velocity, position, and current to meet your application's needs.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling to ensure smooth operation and avoid common pitfalls.


## Purpose

This API is intended for developers and engineers working with ODrive Pro motor controllers in applications that require high-torque BLDC motors. Whether you're working on robotics, automation, or any other project involving precision motor control, this API provides a solid foundation for integrating ODrive Pro into your system.
